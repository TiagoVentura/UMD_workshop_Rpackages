# UMD_workshop_Rpackages
This repository contains the files I used in the GSA Methods Workshop I thought on Writing R Packages. The workshop happened on March 25

The folder has two files:

- The R code where I show some review of functional programming and then how to write packages

- The files for the presentation used during the workshop. The presentation is avaiables on my [Rpubs]("http://rpubs.com/Ventura_Tiago/umd_gsawork")
